Goodreads Book Data Project
What's This About?
This project is about grabbing and cleaning up book data from Goodreads, specifically from their "Best 100 Books Ever" list. Goodreads is a cool site where book lovers can find and review books, and Amazon owns it. We're diving into this list to see what we can learn!

Getting the Data
First up, we need to get our hands on the data. This means collecting info from Goodreads, like book titles, authors, and ratings. Think of it like gathering all the ingredients before you start cooking.

Cleaning Things Up
Once we've got the data, we need to tidy it up. This is like making sure all your ingredients are prepped and ready to go. We clean and organize the data so it's easy to work with later.

What We’re Looking At
Here’s what we’re pulling from the list:

Number: Where the book ranks on the list
Author Name: Who wrote the book
Book Title: The name of the book
Average Rating: How people rate the book on average
Ratings: How many people rated it
Score: The book's score on the list
Votes: How many votes it got
Rating Category: Is it a low, medium, or high rating?
Publishing Date: When the book first came out
Pages: How many pages it has
Rating per Vote Ratio: How ratings compare to votes
Score per Rating: Score divided by ratings
Publishing Year: The year it was published
Why Do This?
By looking at all this data, we can get some cool insights into what makes these books so popular. Whether you're a bookworm, a data geek, or just curious, there's something interesting to find!
